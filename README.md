# Horiseon-Reafactor

## Description
I refactored the code given to me from the bootcamp, This was to put in semantic HTML as well as simplify some of the CSS code. This helped me put in semantic code to HTML but helped me realize the layout for HTML pages. This also helped me reconize patterns within the CSS code to reduce the lines of code needed while achiving the same result.
